# 30 Days of JavaScript Practice

A comprehensive repository dedicated to mastering JavaScript through 30 days of consistent coding challenges. This project tracks my progress from fundamental syntax to advanced logic and functional programming.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into daily modules, each focusing on specific JavaScript concepts:

* **Days 1-10**: Core foundations including variables, data types, loops, and basic functions.
* **Days 11-20**: Intermediate logic, array manipulations, and object-oriented programming basics.
* **Days 21-30**: Advanced topics, complex problem solving, and functional programming patterns.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Daily Exercises**: Structured scripts designed to reinforce daily learning goals.
* **ES6+ Syntax**: Practice with modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals.
* **Logic Building**: Focused tasks to improve algorithmic thinking and clean code practices.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to any specific day (e.g., `Day-1.js`).
3. Run the script using Node.js:
```bash
node Day-1.js

```



## 📈 Learning Goal

The objective of this repository was to build a strong practical foundation in JavaScript to transition into full-stack development and systems engineering.
